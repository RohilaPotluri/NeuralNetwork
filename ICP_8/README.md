I have created epoches, trained and tested the data. "encoded" is the encoded representation of the input and "decoded" is the lossy reconstruction of the input. Added a new hidden layer to the encooder and the decoder and calculated the loss and accuracy of model by creating a history object. Later, for denoisening autocoder, introduced noise and plotted the original and reconstructed image using matplotlib library.
