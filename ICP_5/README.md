In ICP_5_1, I have implemented naïve bayes method using scikit learn library using the glass dataset provided. Used train_test_split to create training and testing part. By using Naïve bayes classifier , and by using 0.2 as test_size. Then I evaluated the model on test part using score.I observed 37.5% accuracy
In ICP_5_2, I have implemented SVM method using scikit learn library using the glass dataset provided. Used train_test_split to create training and testing part. By using SVM classifier , and by using 0.2 as test_size. Then I evaluated the model on test part using score. I observed 66.7% accuracy
Here I got better accuracy with linear SVM than NB. NB uses a probabalistic analysis and all features are independent where as linear SVM uses geometrical analysis.
