Image classification with CNN.

Training the model, Evaluating the model and transposing the shape by changing dimensions and later creating the sequential model using the sequential API.Next I have checked the performance of the model by observing the accuracy. The accuracy of the model has slightly improved with the addition of more layers and higher number of feature maps, but also increased the complexity and training time of the model. The new model architecture provided in the instruction includes several new layers and higher number of feature maps.
Later,predicted the first 4 images of the test data using the above model. Then, compared with the actual label for those 4 images to check if the model has predicted correctly.
Created a history object for visualizing Loss and Accuracy and used that to plot the graphs.
