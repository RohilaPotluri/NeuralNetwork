In ICP_2_1, I have defined a function named string_alterenative and passed str parameter and then given first name and last name from console and attached both of them as full name and then altered the full name string so that it returns every other char in the string.

In ICP_2_2, I Created the input .txt file with the provided two strings in read mode and them created a empty dictionary and then removed lines and spaces between the words and created a loop to count the words repeating in the file and stored them output.txt file in write mode as keys and values where the key means words repeating in the input file and values are occurrences.

In ICP_2_3, I created a list of heights in inches and then I created a list of cms(centimeters) then in for loop I in the I multiplied each element with 2.45 so that I can convert the inches to centimeters in cm list a list of centimeters. And created a list comprehension L2
