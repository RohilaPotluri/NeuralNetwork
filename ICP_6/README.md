Used the use case in the class and added more Dense layers to the existing code and checked how the accuracy changes. Changed the data source to Breast Cancer dataset * available in the source code folder. Normalized the data before feeding the data to the model and checked how the normalization changes the accuracy. Later obtained plots for both the and accuracy for both training data and validation data using the history object in the sourcecode. Obtained one of the images in the test data, and then do inferencing to check the prediction of the model. I used 2 hidden layers and Relu activation. Tried to change the number of hidden layer and the activation to tanh or sigmoid and see what happens ran the same code without scaling the images and checked the performance.
